My laptop, being a couple of years old, probably has quite some gunk underneath its keyboard. It was getting harder to type, close to being unusable, until I finally removed the keys to clean the base. Here's how I did it.

1) Fit something slim under to raise the key cap, then use your fingers to remove it.

2.1) Fit something slim between the two halves of the key hinge, then twist to pop it out. Drawback: you have to fit the two halves back together later, which is quite a pain.

2.2) Alternatively, fit something under the key hinge to remove it quickly. This is pretty scary since the hinge looks so flimsy, and I have broken some of them.

3) Remove the rubber dome thing, which is glued on.  

4) Clean the base (remove hair, wipe it down etc).  

4.5) If the hinge was separated into two parts, find the correct orientation of each half of the key hinge (make sure each half catches onto the metal hooks). Then fit both halfs together carefully, such that they sit flush with each other.

5) Replace the hinge: first hook one half, then press down on the other half to clip it in.  

6) Replace the rubber dome thing (don't have to glue it back).  

7) Replace the key cap: pop it back in place by gently pressing down on it.  

Lastly, be ready use up every bit of patience available!
